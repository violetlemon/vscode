# Study & Python setup notes for VSCode

## Useful extensions

1. Python
2. Kite (for better documentation, but need kite engine to be installed separately)
3. AREPL (which does not seems to work with numpy)
4. autoDocstring (for generating python docstrings)

## Useful tips

1. Click on Python version on bottom right to change python interpreter
2. "settings.json" under local .vscode directory can be merged to the global setting to apply the setting globally
3. "reload window" to pick up new changes, through Command Pallete or Ctrl + R
4. Shift + Enter runs selected code interactively
